funding_paragraph: |
  The work on the ÍST TS was primarily funded by Arion Banki, Íslandsbanki and Landsbankinn. It is the result of the workgroup TN-FMÞ-VH-8. In part, the work is based on the earlier workshop agreement WA-310 authored by TN-FMÞ-VH-2 on Technical Requirements, and TN-FMÞ-VH-1 on Business Requirements, with the participation of an external consultant. 
  WA-310 was approved within TN-FMÞ on 2019-12-12. 
  ÍST TS-310 should, however, not be viewed as a direct successor to that agreement, which focused on laying groundwork for PSD2 compliance. 
  ÍST TS-310 is not related to PSD2 compliance, though it could be used by participants as a foundation for their dedicated interface, if so desired. 
  Instead TS-310 is the next version of the Icelandic Online Banking Services, replacing TS 161:2013 *Greiðslur* and TS 164:2013 *Yfirlit bankareikninga*.
